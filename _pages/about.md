I am a second-year PhD student at Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland College Park, advised by [Jia-Bin Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/jbhuang). My research interest is in computer vision and multimodal perception. I'm currently working on 3D and 4D reconstruction with generative prior.
